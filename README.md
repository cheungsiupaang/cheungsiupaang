## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Nankai University, supervised by [Prof. Han Jianda](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/2796.htm) and [Prof. Liang Xiao](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1034/4844.htm). Before this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation at Nankai University in 2021.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on robotics, aerial manipulators, and motion planning.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Cheung Siupaang is my name in Cantonese, and Zhang Zhaopeng is my name in Mandarin.
